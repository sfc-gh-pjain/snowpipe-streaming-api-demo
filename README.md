# snowpipe-streaming-api-demo

## Prerequisites:

1. You can deploy this in your own docker client. We will not cover how to install docker, but its very easy, you can check it at https://www.docker.com/get-started/

2. Some familiarity with java programming will help to understand the demo better

3. We are using community version of mysql server for demo purpose only, user and password are simple but in actaul production you can use your own strong authentication guidelines


## How to run this demo

1.	Clone, fork or download this repo to local or where you desire to run this demo

2.	We are using key pair authentication to communicate with Snowflake (default). You can setup key-pair using this link [Snowflake key pari authentication setup](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication)

3.	Update your account specific information in the *snowflake_account_config.properties* file. Paste your PEM private key in this file in a single line, do not include begin and end lines (from above step)

4.	Open the **setup_snowflake.sql** file in text editor to copy and paste its content into a Snowflake worksheet and click **Run All**. This will setup a database and target table. Change it to your specific role if needed.

5.	Go to **snowpipe-streaming-api-demo** (root folder) and run this command (for first time it will take a while)
    `docker compose up`

6.	Once the streaming load is completed you can verify your data in snowflake target table and bring the docker services down by running
    `docker compose down`


## What you will learn

1. Snowflake ingest SDK has a streaming API that can be used to replicate or ingest delta records from your database or transaction system into Snowflake. 

2. Create custom Java application to build streaming pipeline into Snowflake

3. Create Streaming data ingestion without any message broker like Kafka

## What is not convered in this demo

1. Architecture for a highly available system
2. Fault taulerance with Streaming system
3. Error handling
